**Control psychological examination, suspected attention disorder, bilingual environment**

**Personal history:**

**Specialist care:**
- Psychological care: Since 3/2022, suspected mild ADHD.
- Logopedic care: Up until 2022, then home-based speech therapy.

**Interview with grandmother:**
- Persistent issues with attention and behavior. Loses focus quickly and struggles to work independently. Tends to fixate on details and disengage from the task. Deteriorating academic performance. Does not like changes and prefers things to remain the same. In social settings, he does not have problems; he makes friends easily and is friendly. He argues with his older sister and sometimes hits her in anger. Needs rules to be clearly explained. He tends to get upset or cry when emotional but is not aggressive, and his anger passes quickly. He struggles with preparing for school, works better with math but has difficulties with reading and writing. He finished 2nd grade, part of which was spent in Spain, where he attended a private English school. He received tutoring in English, and his grandmother taught him Czech. He ended the school year with a grade of 2 in math and Czech. Initially, he disliked school, but this improved after six months. He will be entering 3rd grade. He enjoys cars, machines, ball games, and Lego. He attends a tennis club. He adapts poorly to new environments and prefers consistency (e.g., food, toys). He needs to be monitored to ensure he completes his schoolwork on time.

**Interview with the boy:**
- He had friends at school, and he will be attending 5th grade in Spain. He attends an English school, knows a lot of vocabulary, and communicates with friends in English. He was good at math and played tennis. He spends most of his holidays in the countryside with his grandmother and sister, playing with friends.

**Observation:**
- Cooperative, though somewhat less motivated and withdrawn. Slower work pace. In math tasks, he struggled with counting (e.g., forgot the number 20, miscounted due to not noticing a block had fallen). Some grammatical errors and mild difficulties with understanding complex instructions were noted (e.g., mathematical problems such as "three times more than...").

**Test results (IDS - Intelligence and Development Scales):**
- **Cognitive abilities**: Within the norm for his age, but there was a significant difference between verbal and non-verbal tasks, with uneven performance across subtests. Below-average results in motor subtests.
- **Cognitive functions**: Performance ranged from below average (e.g., visual perception, auditory memory) to above average (e.g., visuospatial memory, conceptual thinking).
- **Psychomotor skills**: Below average in fine motor skills and visuomotor coordination.
- **Mathematics**: Lower average performance.
- **Speech**: Deeply below average in both expressive and receptive language.
- **Verbal thinking**: Average performance.

**Conners 3 (parent version, completed by grandmother)**: Elevated scores across all scales (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, behavior problems, executive function, defiance/aggression, peer relationships), with a slight increase in the negative impression (2 items).

**Conclusions:**
- The boy, aged 8 years and 9 months, was examined for suspected attention disorder. He had previously been assessed in 2022, with a tentative diagnosis of mild ADHD. Currently, his intellectual abilities are within the norm for his age, but his performance was uneven, with a clinically significant difference between verbal and non-verbal tasks. The grandmother reports an increase in inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, as well as associated problems. In the testing situation, fluctuations in attention, impaired planning and task execution (especially in math), and language difficulties (grammatical errors, number naming issues, poor comprehension) were observed. There was also a weakness in fine motor and visuomotor skills. The boy's weakened verbal abilities may be related to his bilingual upbringing and partial education in a foreign language. The motor skill weakness and attention problems align with a diagnosis of ADHD, though environmental factors (such as living in Barcelona and attending an international school) may have contributed to the boy's presentation. Since the child was not assessed with a parent present, the conclusions are only provisional.

**Recommendations:**
- Consider implementing support measures in school in collaboration with the Psychological-Pedagogical Counseling Center (PPP).
- Maintain a regular routine and communicate changes clearly to the child.
- Use shorter work periods with increased support for completing tasks and include breaks.
